    <h1>Id and class </h1>
    <h3>HTML offers multiple ways to select and style elements. Two of the most commonly used selectors are IDs and Classes. This blog explores what they are, how to use them, and their differences.</h3>

    <h2><strong>What is an ID?</strong></h2>
    <h3>An ID is an attribute, a unique identifier assigned to only one HTML element within a page. It is often used for unique styling and JavaScript manipulations.</h3>

    <div id="myUniqueID">This is a div with an ID.</div>

    <h2>What are Classes?</h2>
<h3>The class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple HTML elements. That way, you can easily change their look or behavior all at once. Classes are not unique and can be assigned to multiple elements. They are generally used for applying the same styles or behaviors to a group of elements.</h3>

<h2>Differences Between IDs and Classes</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Uniqueness:</strong> IDs are unique, and classes can be reused.
    </li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> IDs are often used for JavaScript operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Styling: </strong>Both can be used for styling, but IDs have higher specificity.</li>
</ul>
